This project is a **content-based recommendation system** that recommends items to users based on their past interactions with items. The system uses **natural language processing techniques** to recommend similar items based on their textual content.

## Features
The system has the following key features:

- Data preprocessing and preparation for content-based recommendations
- Natural Language Processing with techniques like stop-word removal, tokenization, stemming
- Similarity calculation using cosine similarity
- Web-based interface using streamlit

## Technology Stack
The project is built using the following technologies:

- Python - Programming language used to implement recommendation algorithms
- Streamlit - Python web framework used to build the web-based interface
- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) - Python library used for natural language processing
